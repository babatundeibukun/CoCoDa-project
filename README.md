# CoCoDa Project

**CoCoDa** (Concentration Of Control and Data) is a research-focused take-home project that explores technical interventions to mitigate systemic issues in mobile apps and Very Large Online Platforms(VLOPs) as conceptualized in the Digital Services Act (DSA). The project presents three distinct technical approaches to amending app user interfaces, each documented and implemented in its own method-specific file.

## Project Overview

The project has two main aims: 1) combine existing technical data access methods with novel legal approaches like the DSA and create new technical methods on this foundation, and to 2) advance current legally mandated platform data access methods and make them work in practice. This research will be grounded in two use cases in the domains of social media and mobile applications. By creating integrated “techno-legal” tools, the project supports regulators, researchers, and civil society in studying and mitigating systemic risks arising from data and control concentration in Very Large Online Platforms (VLOPs).

### 📁 Methods

#### 🔧 Method 1 – **GreaseMilkyway**
A UI-level amendment system that uses accessibility overlays or scripting to manipulate on-screen components without needing root access or app recompilation. Ideal for surface-level interventions.

#### 🧩 Method 2 – **GreaseDroid**
A reverse engineering approach where apps are decompiled, modified at the code or resource level, and repackaged. This method targets deeper structural changes to the app UI and behavior.

#### 🤖 Method 3 – **GreaseTerminator**
A machine learning-based vision system that detects harmful or non-compliant UI patterns (e.g., deceptive consent flows) and amends them using image-based transformations or automation.

## Motivation

This project aligns with recent scholarship advocating for user empowerment and the "right to repair" in the mobile ecosystem especially in accordance with the DSA 2022 about mitigating systemic risks propagated by VLOPs. By equipping users and developers with practical tools to contest and reshape app interfaces, CoCoDa engages with a growing movement towards ethical and accountable technology.
