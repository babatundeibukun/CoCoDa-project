# Technical Setup Documentation and Challenges for GreaseTerminator Project Repository
---

## Overview

This document outlines the process and technical challenges encountered while setting up and running the ML-vision Python-based project cloned from the GitHub repository. The repository did not provide a `requirements.txt` file, making environment setup more manual and technically demanding.

---

## Environment Preparation

To ensure isolated package management and avoid conflicts with global Python installations, I opted to use a virtual environment. My computer has multiple Python versions installed, including 3.1, 3.7, 3.9, 3.11 with `py -0` confirming:

```bash
$ py -0

```

**Virtual environment setup:**

```bash
py -3.7 -m venv myenv
source myenv/Scripts/activate  

```

No success/error message appeared upon creation or activation, which made troubleshooting difficult. I verified activation using:

```bash
where python
```
which shows the  problem, I was eventually able to create a virtual environment with python 3.7 since 3.9 worked but was running into problems with scikit-learn installation , it couldn't build wheels for scikit-learn. 
---

## Dependency Installation

The repository lacked a `requirements.txt`, so I manually attempted to install packages as errors arose during script execution.


```
Before I tried to use python 3.7 , I was initially using python 3.9 It was all sucessfull until I tried to run the entire script , it was capturing the images shown on the android but it was in black and white and it didn't blur out the image and it was throwing  the error , 

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sklearn.linear_model.logistic'

Installing `scikit-learn` required a specific version compatible with Python 3.7, as newer versions dropped support.

## Recommendations for Repository Improvement

- Add `requirements.txt` with pinned versions for these dependencies:
  ```txt
  scikit-learn
  opencv-python
  numpy
  matplotlib
  pillow
  requests
  imutils
  pytesseract
  hatesonar
  imagehash
  nudenet
  ```

- Include setup instructions in a `README.md`:
  - How to create and activate a virtual environment.
  - How to install dependencies.
  - Expected Python version.
  - download and install Tesseract-OCR
